/**************************************************************************************
* This is a sample demonstration application that showcases usage of rpmsg
* This application is meant to run on the remote CPU running bare-metal code.
* It echoes back data that was sent to it by the master core.
*
* The application calls init_system which defines a shared memory region in
* MPU settings for the communication between master and remote using
* zynqMP_r5_map_mem_region API,it also initializes interrupt controller
* GIC and register the interrupt service routine for IPI using
* zynqMP_r5_gic_initialize API.
*
* Echo test calls the remoteproc_resource_init API to create the
* virtio/RPMsg devices required for IPC with the master context.
* Invocation of this API causes remoteproc on the bare-metal to use the
* rpmsg name service announcement feature to advertise the rpmsg channels
* served by the application.
*
* The master receives the advertisement messages and performs the following tasks:
* 	1. Invokes the channel created callback registered by the master application
* 	2. Responds to remote context with a name service acknowledgement message
* After the acknowledgement is received from master, remoteproc on the bare-metal
* invokes the RPMsg channel-created callback registered by the remote application.
* The RPMsg channel is established at this point. All RPMsg APIs can be used subsequently
* on both sides for run time communications between the master and remote software contexts.
*
* Upon running the master application to send data to remote core, master will
* generate the payload and send to remote (bare-metal) by informing the bare-metal with
* an IPI, the remote will send the data back by master and master will perform a check
* whether the same data is received. Once the application is ran and task by the
* bare-metal application is done, master needs to properly shut down the remote
* processor
*
* To shut down the remote processor, the following steps are performed:
* 	1. The master application sends an application-specific shut-down message
* 	   to the remote context
* 	2. This bare-metal application cleans up application resources,
* 	   sends a shut-down acknowledge to master, and invokes remoteproc_resource_deinit
* 	   API to de-initialize remoteproc on the bare-metal side.
* 	3. On receiving the shut-down acknowledge message, the master application invokes
* 	   the remoteproc_shutdown API to shut down the remote processor and de-initialize
* 	   remoteproc using remoteproc_deinit on its side.
